An AI-powered document review workspace that transforms unstructured legal contracts into structured, queryable datasets. Designed for legal professionals, auditors, and procurement teams to accelerate due diligence and contract analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Extraction**: Automatically extract key clauses, dates, amounts, and entities from PDFs using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro / 3.0.
- **High-Fidelity Conversion**: Uses **Docling** (running locally) to convert PDFs and DOCX files to clean Markdown text, preserving formatting and structure without hallucination.
- **Dynamic Schema**: Define columns with natural language prompts (e.g., "What is the governing law?").
- **Verification & Citations**: Click any extracted cell to view the exact source quote highlighted in the original document.
- **Spreadsheet Interface**: A high-density, Excel-like grid for managing bulk document reviews.
- **Integrated Chat Analyst**: Ask questions across your entire dataset (e.g., "Which contract has the most favorable MFN clause?").

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tabular-review.git
cd tabular-review
```

### 2. Setup Frontend
Install Node dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory for your Google API Key:
```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

### 3. Setup Backend (Docling)
The backend is required for document conversion.

```bash
cd server
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run
Start the backend (in one terminal):
```bash
cd server
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

Start the frontend (in another terminal):
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 🐳 Docker Deployment (Alternative)

You can also run the application using Docker:

1. **Setup environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Google Gemini API key
   ```

2. **Build and run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000/docs

The Docker setup includes:
- **Frontend**: React app served by Node.js static server
